Markdown Content:
**Important:** I have merged my store to  To receive free updates for life on this plugin, please purchase from.

Get rid of Final Cut Pro's frustrating keyframe system, and level up your editing with this powerful zoom plugin!

Built from the ground up with simplicity for editors in mind.

Featuring extremely easy to use On Screen Controls, complete control over speed settings, zoom modes and pan modes. Plus everything has been created to work perfectly with square and vertical video formats!

**IMPORTANT:**

**There is currently an issue with Final Cut Pro 10.8 that makes the On Screen Controls unusable with a trackpad. If you are planning on purchasing, and use a trackpad to edit, I would recommend holding off until FCP 10.8.1+ is released, so that those issues can be addressed!**

**Requires Final Cut Pro 10.4+**
