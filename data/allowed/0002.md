### **A whole new way to breathe life into your art.**

Create dynamic illustrations with the _Harmonics Collection_ — an entirely new Jingsketch brush collection with refreshing new shapes, textures, and an exciting new color blending approach. This brush collection was meticulously created to speed up your workflow while adding a new level of depth to your shapes and colors.

*   **Powerful industry-standard tools.** These brushes were built by the same creator behind best-selling brushes trusted by artists at _Pixar_, _Epic Games_, _Gearbox_, _Mattel_, and more.
*   **Vibrant and expressive.** Create anything, from colorful landscapes, to portrait illustrations, to relaxing sketches.
*   **Easy to use. Easy to master.** Brushes are organized into intuitive brushsets: _Sharp Sketch_, _Smooth Paint_, _Coarse Paint_, _Textures_ and _Harmonics_ — and each brush is labeled with easy-to-understand names.

### **What is _Harmonics_?**

In addition to a wide range of new brushes for sketching and painting included in this collection, a major theme behind the _Harmonics_ set is the ability to create harmonic color combinations automagically. New brushes included in the _Harmonics_ folder have built-in settings to generate elegant and complementary in-between colors all by themselves as demonstrated below.

These brushes are the perfect new way to save you precious time when painting, creating all kinds of happy accidents along the way. Sometimes, I get surprised by some of the bold colors that emerge and save them for future use. I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do.
