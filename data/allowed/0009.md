NewBest Oil Painting Class! I've watched many YouTube videos and taken other online courses before, but Florent's class is by far the most well-structured and comprehensive. He covers oil painting fundamentals in a clear, organized way that’s helpful for all levels. I even realized that some of the supplies I had been using weren’t suitable! The demonstrations are fantastic, making it easy to understand!

I am about to finish my first video. I really dont know anything about art. However, the instructor makes me want to learn soooo much. I know it just the beginning but with the first video I am already hooked. I can not imagine once we actually start painting !!!

This is without a doubt the best guide for new painters that I have ever seen! Indeed, I wish I had seen this when I was new to painting many years ago. It would have saved me so much agony and I would have been further along much sooner! My only complaint is that I did have some difficulty getting into the program and, Florent, if you are reading this, please, please fix this. But I won’t take a star off because, in the end, it was soooo worth it! I’m so glad I bought the whole package!! Thank you!

Excellent course for both beginners and intermediate painters. Mr. Farges has great video editing abilities, making the course very pleasing to watch. Overall good!

Having watching a few of Florent’s, youtube videos, I thought this would be the course for me. As he also mentioned water mixable oil paints, which for me is important as suffering with COPD solvents are too dangerous. He did not cover water mixable oil in any depth. There was also no indication on how to apply the paint or how to blend on the canvas. Apart from a few tips I have essentially paid for a watch me paint video. So I am disappointed. Martin.
