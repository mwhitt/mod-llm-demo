**People love using TextSniper**:

Gary Chike 👍   
_TextSniper has been a life saver. I had to take an online course that had questions in which the text were not selectable. So I was able to use TextSniper OCR to copy the text and paste it into a search engine to review._

Chauncey Davis 👍   
_I love this little app - I do a lot of training docs, and sometimes I need to grab quotes and more so numbers and codes that are in screen shots or images._

E Chu 👍   
_Awesome app! I use it to capture slide contents on Zoom calls. Highly recommended. Fast and accurate!_

Danielle Williams 👍  
_Can't imagine my computer without it. It does exactly what it says. I needed some text off of a pdf and it took it in perfectly._

Even with macOS having some text recognition, this is still a far superior way to grab text off the screen.
