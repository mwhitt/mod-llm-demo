### **FAQ**

**What is Gamified Life OS?**  
Gamified Life OS is a productivity tool created in Notion. It combines gamification with regular daily life activities such as habits, tasks, goals, reading, and even cooking, to create a uniquely effective productivity system.

**Can I learn more about Gamified Life OS?**  
Sure! Head here: **_Gamified Life OS_**

**Where else can I buy Gamified Life OS?**  
The only **official and authorized** **marketplaces** with Gamified Life OS are Gumroad, the Notion Marketplace, NichePlates, Notions.ws, and NotionCircles. Any unauthorized stores selling Gamified Life OS are likely **scams** and will **not** provide lifetime customer service and free upgrades.

**Which theme is the best?**  
All of the themes simply differ aesthetically. The functions and features are all still the same. I suggest you pick a theme that suits your personality. My personal favorite is the Studio Ghibli theme.

**What makes this different from other "Gamification" systems?**  
Gamified Life OS has always been about a good balance of gaming and practical use. I made sure that this system was the perfect mix of both. At the end of the day, we want an efficient and practical productivity tool, but something enjoyable to use.

**Is this worth the price?**  
Consider it a worthy investment. Gamified Life OS is a powerful productivity tool that can skyrocket your progress in life. It is the system I personally use to run my life. Plus, you get over 12 dedicated Life Management Systems all designed to earn you EXP. Buying them separately could cost you more!

**Do you do refunds?**  
Unfortunately, we do not. Due to this being a digital product, a refund wouldn't be possible. However, you may contact Kevechino for any concerns at all for help. We have a **Total Satisfaction Policy**.

**Support, access, updates, and instructions?**  
You will have lifetime access, free upgrades, and support via email. The template comes with thorough instructions on how to use and set up your system.

NewThis is the BEST task organization notion template I have found! And 5 stars are not enough to say how good it is. I used its free version with a few other templates to cover my "complicated life" and soon decided to upgrade myself with the paid one - so I can track everything with one template only! And it worked with the help of Kevechino. The creator, Kevechino, is very responsive to my questions and supported me finding solution for personalization needs. Highly recommended it to everyone pass by this review :）

The most affordable and fulfilling notion template I've ever bought. I can really see that kev has put a lot of love and effort in making this template, what i love most about it, is the progress bar and how i get to see myself level in real-life in real-time, that's something I've truly been missing since I had no way in notion to track it in a nice and visual way. Every dashboard there is super helpful from drinking your meds to water and books and movies, its truly a working lifeOS and one you have complete control over to customize. Definitely give this template a try you won't be disappointed one bit :\>
