Overall it's 208 presets that will speed up your editing process.

**And you can use them however you want - for a video from vacation or a TV commercial you're cutting for a big ad agency.**

Additionally, if you purchase the $59 version, you will have access to future updates, including new presets that I will be adding to the pack. You will also be able to submit preset requests through a form I have created. **This means the pack will continue to expand over the years!**

* * *

Often when we get a plugin or a preset to improve our editing arsenals, weÂ are fixing a problem, but we're also adding an extra step. It's time for you to switchÂ it up and actually save time while editing.

We're fixing a non-creative problem: you're wasting time! Stop:

*   creating newÂ keyframes for every zoom you want to add to a clip,
*   clicking 10 times to set the guides just the way you need them,
*   re-applying Warp Stabilizer with default settings.

With Ultimate Presets you will startÂ saving time today and it will add up in the long run. Think about the manyÂ things you can do with extra time: finally watch that last season of Seinfeld, learn to play the octobass, get married to that girlÂ you've been dating for 12 years (it's time)... so many possibilities!

### **Versatile**

Almost all of the presets can be used on adjustment layers which lets you apply this effect to multiple layers (ie. graphics) at the same time.

To apply the presets you simply drag and drop from the Effects panel.

### **Fast render time**

All of the presets are GPU-accelerated and resolution-independent.

You can use them in 4K, UHD, 1080p timelines, and for vertical and square aspect ratios.

### **Customizable**

You can access keyframes and adjust the speed if you need to.

With anchor-type information provided, you can make changes to presets easily and have total control over the results.

All **208 presets** are as flexible as we could have made them: resolution-independent,Â easily accessible keyframes, can be used in a wide variety of scenarios and they'reÂ all GPU accelerated.
