Hiiiii, friends! 🎉 I’m so excited to announce the launch of the second edition of my holiday e-cookbook: Baking Spirits Bright: Oh What Fun! 🍰🎄💖 It's been sprinkled with fresh edits and some new treats!

Inside, you’ll find a delightful assortment of over 40 recipes, from cozy treats to stunning desserts that are sure to wow your friends and family. This cookbook is a heartfelt celebration of a few of my favorite things: the joy of baking, sharing delicious moments with loved ones, and, of course, the pure magic of Christmas! 🍪✨

Baking is my love language, and I can hardly wait for you to bring these delightful recipes into your homes this holiday season! It really does fill my heart to help you create sweet, forever memories with those you cherish. So, grab your mixing bowls, dust off those aprons, ready your spatulas, and let’s spread some holiday cheer, one scrumptious treat at a time!

(P.S. Yes, I did win Cupcake Wars, but don’t worry—there’s a whole lot more than just cupcakes in this book!)

I want this!

Let's get to baking!
