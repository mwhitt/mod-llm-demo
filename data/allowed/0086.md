> “Taylor helped us with our financial model when we were planning to go raise capital. He was fast to respond and even walked us through all the dependencies of the model. When it came time to update the model a year later, he was very responsive to help and adjust it based off of our product updates. It was a great experience and am super thankful for the assistance.”

Walkthrough

Highlights

*   The base for creating a forecast for fundraising and business planning for startups and entrepreneurs.
*   Built for subscription, SaaS (consumer and enterprise), ecommerce, retail, hardware, manufacturing, marketplaces, apps, physical products, and many other types of businesses.

*   Made for founders, finance executives, and investors to create a model for an idea-stage, pre-seed, seed, A, or B stage company

Structure

The default timescale is a monthly model with annual summaries, built for 72 months, or 6 years. Easy to amend the total time period - shorter or longer.

Change the base timescale from months to quarters or years by selecting a dropdown. Years can be absolute (e.g. 2022) or relative (e.g. Year 1) to make it easy to create forecasts of speculative businesses and starting points.

Easy to add in actual financials to create forward-looking rolling forecasts and historical budget v. actual variances.

Built for many different revenue models

Prebuilt revenue model that can be used for SaaS, subscriptions, ecommerce, and many types of revenue models. In addition, the model is completely unlocked, so you may build in any logic to forecast your revenues and expenses - growth rates, customers, users, employees, etc. - in any way you want. More details on integrating a custom revenue model are at How to integrate any model into a Foresight base model.

Prebuilt to handle paid and organic acquisition methods, conversion rates, seasonality adjustments to growth rates, conversion rates, and revenues, retention and churn, any contract cycle and billing cycle (to handle contract and payment cycles), revenue recognition and deferred revenues.

Optionally, prebuilt to handle bookings and billings, MRR and ARR, and creates standard SaaS reporting charts (MRR movements, subscriber growth, and more).

Optionally, prebuilt to handle cost of sales, inventory, inventory purchasing and payment cycles, and standard ecommerce revenue considerations.

For more details, here are a few detailed examples of how to use the model for a few popular business models:

*   How to model SaaS using the Standard Financial Model
*   How to model Ecommerce using the Standard Financial Model
*   How to model Marketplaces using the Standard Financial Model
*   How to Model Services and Consulting Businesses using the Standard Financial Model
*   How to Model Hardware Businesses using the Standard Financial Model

Easy to create cost forecasts

The model offers an extensive structure for forecasting costs, allowing you to input specific costs, one-off and repeating costs using growth rates, and driver-based forecasts, calculating expenses from financial and operational metrics. Each expense line can be selected, through dropdowns, into preset (but editable) SG&A and Cost of Sales categories for reporting purposes.

Create hiring plans by inputting specific roles and hires, or let hires be determined by other metrics (e.g. employees in a certain function, users, customers, many more options).

Input all your expenses, and select the accounting treatment, and the model will handle how the expense is handled in the financial statements, as well as any resulting effects like depreciation, repayment schedules, and more.

Robust financial and managerial reporting

The model creates consolidated financial statements - income statement (profit and loss, or P&L), balance sheet, and statement of cash flows - on a monthly basis, summarized into annual reports. Applicable worldwide, independent of GAAP or IFRS accounting methods. Equity, debt, and grant funding can be input, and creates sources and uses reports and burn and runway charts automatically.

Model handles corporate taxes and value-added taxes (VAT) automatically, with options for different accrual and payment schedules. Depreciation, accounts receivable, deferred revenues, and other balance sheet calculations have prebuilt logic, change if necessary.

Track actual financials by pulling in Quickbooks, Xero or other (manual data pull or requires third-party integrations) to create rolling forecasts and budget v. actual variances over different time periods.

Assign expenses and revenues to separate business lines and automatically create a P&L that details revenues, expenses and margin profile per segment.

One-time purchase and free access to updates

Model is one .xlsx Excel file or Google Sheets Workbook and is downloaded or accessed immediately. No macros or VBA used. Can be used in Excel, Google Docs, and many other spreadsheet programs. Email or book a call for support anytime. One time purchase, updates automatically distributed for free.

### Use in any recommended spreadsheet program.

Foresight's spreadsheet models can be used in both Excel and Google Sheets interchangeably; simply upload the Microsoft Excel model template from Foresight into Google Sheets, or download the Google Sheets to Excel, and everything will structurally work fine.

The models are originally built in Google Sheets, and the formatting is a bit better in Google Sheets; in Excel you may want to adjust the row spacing, fonts, and chart formatting to get the aesthetics you want.

Author

**Taylor Davidson**, Founder, Foresight

I created the financial models behind Foresight so early-stage entrepreneurs can spend less time on finance and more time on their products. I care about financial modeling because I believe that financial models can help us make critical business decisions even if the models themselves are not “always right”. Financial models can help even the earliest entrepreneurs if we build “minimum viable models” to focus on the decisions that matter most.

**More about me**

*   Started building models for startups in 2000
*   Started Foresight in 2008, full-time since 2014
*   Have worked with thousands of entrepreneurs and venture funds on financial models
*   Former NYC-based venture capital investor
*   Angel investor in 100+ companies
*   Experience in ecommerce growth and analytics
*   Former private equity analyst, strategy consulting associate
*   Former professional photographer
*   MBA in Finance and Accounting

Design Principles

I build _tastefully opinionated_ models that abide by general modeling standards.

Meaning, if you've used a well constructed model before, you'll probably understand the format and layout pretty quickly - here are my formatting conventions. Structurally, I _generally_ true to the Fast Standard for financial modeling, with my own opinions, honed by building models for startups and investors for 24 years, sprinkled throughout.
