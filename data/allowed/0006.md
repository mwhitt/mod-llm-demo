Title: The Watercolor Experience Brush Set for Procreate

Markdown Content:
**The Watercolor Experience Brush Set for Procreate is** my personal journey to achieve **the most realistic and natural possible digital watercolor experience** (not an easy task)...and I'm very happy with the results!

These brushes are made from **real watercolor on real paper** that I carefully painted, scanned and fine-tuned to work as digital brushes. Combined with **high resolution paper textures** and a nice collection of real **watercolor washes sheets and real watercolor stamps** that you can use and mix with your paintings, this is the **ultimate digital tool for watercolor lovers!**

**You can see these brushes in action in the following tutorial:**

This package contains:

**‚Äì86 Procreate brushes made from real watercolor in total (including the ones from the various updates mentioned below)**: soft watercolor washes, hard edge brushes, splatters, watercolor drops, some watercolor brushes with water dilution controlled by pressure sensitivity, a few pencils and inkers and one eraser.

**‚Äì4 different high resolution paper textures** that you can import into your illustrations for a more realistic feel (recommended to do from the beginning for the best experience while painting).

**‚Äì32 real watercolor wash sheets in total (including the ones from the various updates mentioned below)** that you can import into your paintings for an extra layer of watercolor realism.

### **The "All-improved Manero Brushes" Update (08/09/24)**

This set now features unique full-color thumbnails and organizes the brushes into categories for improved navigation. Please use dark mode in Procreate to display these custom thumbnails correctly. Note that opening the thumbnails in Brush Studio will cause them to lose their color. If this happens, reinstalling the set will restore them. Some brushes now support barrel roll on compatible iPads (Apple Pencil Pro required). Look for the ‚ÄúRotate‚Äù üîÑ symbol in their names for quick identification. On non-supported iPads, barrel roll brushes will work with azimuth, a feature that allows you to control rotation with the angle of your Apple Pencil. Brushes that use Color Dynamics can now be quickly identified by looking for the ‚ÄúRainbow‚Äù üåà symbol in their names. Minor tweaks have been made to the brushes for improved performance.

Disclaimer: This brush set is only guaranteed to be fully compatible with Procreate 5 and above, please make sure that you have the correct version before purchasing.
