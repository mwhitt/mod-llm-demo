Understanding Small Business Valuations: A Deep Dive into the Most Probable Selling Price (MPSP) Report By Advantage Liquidity Partners Limited

Today, we're exploring small business valuations, focusing on the Most Probable Selling Price (MPSP) Report—a vital tool for small business owners contemplating a sale or other significant transaction. At Advantage Liquidity Partners Limited, we specialize in machinery, equipment valuations, and small business evaluations, ensuring you understand your business's worth in various scenarios.  

.

What is an MPSP?

The Most Probable Selling Price (MPSP) is a comprehensive analysis of a business's financials and qualitative factors. We evaluate:

Historical financial statements

Business longevity and growth prospects

Market positioning and location advantages

Industry benchmarking using private transaction databases

Benchmarking helps us compare your business to industry peers. For instance, when assessing a dry cleaning business, we analyze how its gross margin and operating costs stack up against similar businesses in the market.

MPSP vs. Traditional Appraisals

Unlike appraisals, which assume an all-cash sale, the MPSP accounts for typical small business transaction terms involving:

Seller financing

Clawbacks

Contingent payments tied to performance benchmarks

Since most small businesses aren't sold for full cash at closing, our approach reflects real-world scenarios, ensuring more accurate and practical valuations.

How Do We Prepare the MPSP Report?
1. Financial Data Collection and Normalization

We begin by inputting financial information, focusing on income statements and balance sheets. Next, we normalize these financials to reflect a standard operating scenario. For example:

Owner compensation adjustments: If an owner pays themselves above-market wages, we recalibrate to fair market rates.

Rent adjustments: If the business owner also owns the property, we adjust rent to reflect market rates.

Family involvement adjustments: Recasting wages for family members involved in the business.

2. Transaction Structure Considerations

We analyze the transaction type—asset sale or share sale—as it impacts valuation. For example:

Asset Sale: Typically excludes operating capital. Sellers retain receivables and payables.

Share Sale: Might involve retaining debts or adjusting for cash-free, debt-free scenarios.

Benchmarking and Industry Comparison

We benchmark:

Cost of Sales

Wage Levels

Occupancy Costs

Comparing these metrics against industry averages helps highlight over- or under-performance areas, providing valuable insights for potential buyers and sellers.

Valuation Methodologies

We use a combination of valuation methods, each weighted for accuracy:

Income Approach: Based on historical and projected earnings.

Market Approach: Compares similar business sales.

Cost Approach: Focuses on asset replacement costs.

In a recent case, we weighted two market approaches at 40% each and the income approach at 20%, reflecting industry standards and business specifics.

Forward-Looking Projections

Projecting future performance is crucial. We assess:

Expected sales growth (e.g., inflation-based growth rates of ~4%)

Direct and indirect cost trends

Required capital expenditures and operating capital needs

Qualitative Factors and Key Value Drivers

Beyond numbers, qualitative factors influence valuations:

Historical Profitability: Consistency in earnings

Income Risk: Stability of revenue sources

Growth Potential: Market expansion opportunities

Owner Dependence: Business reliance on the owner

Location & Marketability: Desirability and accessibility

Businesses with strong qualitative attributes often command a premium.

Final Valuation Summary

In one evaluation, the final enterprise value was determined at $236,000 (asset sale basis), adjusting for a required net working capital of $10,000, resulting in a final value of $226,000, including inventory.

Important Notes:

Real estate is valued separately and requires a commercial real estate appraisal.

Transaction terms significantly affect final valuations.

Final Thoughts

Understanding your business's value is crucial for informed decision-making. Our MPSP report not only provides a reliable selling price estimate but also highlights improvement opportunities to maximize your business's worth.

When Should You Hire Your First Employee?

 One of the biggest challenges for small business owners is determining when to hire their first employee. As a startup owner, you may be managing everything on your own, but there comes a point when your workload becomes overwhelming. How do you know if it’s the right time to expand your team? This guide will help you decide when to take the leap and make your first hire.  

Step 1: Track How You Spend Your Time

Before making any hiring decisions, start by keeping a detailed time log. Track everything you do throughout the day, from answering emails and meeting clients to completing technical work. By documenting your tasks, you’ll gain a clear understanding of where your time is being spent.

Step 2: Categorize Tasks by Value

Once you have a record of your workweek, evaluate each task based on the value it brings to your business. A simple way to categorize your tasks is:

$10/hour tasks – Basic admin work (e.g., answering phones, making copies, scheduling appointments).

$100/hour tasks – Skilled technical work or direct sales that generate revenue.

$1,000/hour tasks – High-value activities such as closing big deals or managing critical projects.

$10,000/hour tasks – Strategic decision-making that impacts long-term business growth.

Step 3: Identify Tasks to Delegate

Most small business owners spend too much time on $10 and $100/hour tasks—work that could easily be delegated to someone else. If these low-value activities are consuming a significant portion of your time, hiring an employee to handle them can be a smart investment.

By delegating these tasks, you can shift your focus to revenue-generating activities, business growth strategies, and customer relationships—all of which drive long-term success.

Step 4: Overcome the Fear of Hiring

Hiring your first employee is a big step, and it can feel like a financial risk. However, it’s important to view it as an investment. If bringing in help enables you to close more deals, improve operational efficiency, and boost profitability, then the benefits will far exceed the cost of their salary.

The Power of Leveraging Others

Successful businesses grow by leveraging the time and expertise of others. Hiring an employee isn’t just about lightening your workload—it’s about maximizing your impact. By focusing on high-value tasks and delegating routine work, you’ll be better positioned for long-term business success.

Conclusion & Next Steps

If you’re spending too much time on low-value tasks, it may be time to hire your first employee. The key is to track your time, identify which tasks to delegate, and focus on work that truly contributes to business growth.
