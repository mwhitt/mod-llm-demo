**The Merch Momentum Strategic Graphics Guide Series** offers a niche-focused graphics bundle and corresponding strategy guide to help Merch By Amazon and print-on-demand creators of apparel and novelty products master a niche and seize potentially untapped or ignored sales opportunities.

This **fishing and hunting niche** graphics strategy guide includes:

*   A 20+ page fishing and hunting niche strategy guide
*   10+ unique and exclusive hand-drawn graphics (transparent background PNGS) created by Adam Guballa of www.tshirtfella.com for your use or to modify on Merch By Amazon or your POD platform of choice
*   A keyword list to improve your chances of finding buyers in this competitive and lucrative niche
*   Suggestions for cross-over and sub-niche apparel, graphics, and product opportunities

**The Merch Momentum Graphics Strategy Guide Series** is designed to solve one of the single biggest mistakes POD professionals make when acquiring a new graphics bundle: limiting the use of the graphics to simple concepts and only within the niche to which those graphics belong.

The power and potential of this new strategy resource lies in the focus on crossover and sub-niche opportunities, which are poorly understood and poorly utilized. What exactly is a crossover niche opportunity? Consider, for example, two niches with larger buyer markets: Nurses and astrology. Each niche has products that sell very well. But when you fuse the two (e.g., "Taurus Nurses Are Tough, Tender and Talented") you have created an entirely new (and sometimes exclusive) way to reach buyers in BOTH marketplaces. Sub-niche opportunities refer to small, nuanced aspects of a much larger niche (example: tshirts for emergency room nurses represent a sub-niche of generalized tshirts for nurses).

In this new graphics series, you will be empowered with suggestions and leads based on data, empirical market observations, and sales successes/failures to provide direction on how you can take one important or valuable niche and cross over into other niches or subniches, thereby augmenting your market reach, the value of your time/investment, and, hopefully, your royalties.
