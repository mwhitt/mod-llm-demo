Title: Detailed Gluten Free Restaurant Card - Latin America (Spanish)

Markdown Content:
### **This is an extremely detailed Spanish gluten free card, written by a celiac and translated by native Spanish speakers from Latin America familiar with the condition. I traveled the world with celiac disease for a decade and created these cards in 2014 to help others with the condition travel safely.**

#### This card can be used for Central America, South America, Cuba, and Mexico, as well as for Puerto Rico.

#### ðŸš«ðŸŒ¾ Show this card to restaurants, hotel staff, chefs, or anyone preparing your food to help make sure that your food requirements are communicated politely and accurately â€” and that they are taken seriously.

### **Accessing your card**

Upon purchase, you will receive an email receipt with a green 'download' button. On your computer, click the download button and download:

ðŸ“±your **digital download (PNG image file)** with Spanish only, sized specifically for your smartphone, and/or

ðŸ–¨ your **printable PDF version** of the detailed gluten free restaurant card with English on one side and Spanish on the other.

You will also receive a second email from me, sent automatically upon any purchase, with the English translation written out in full.

### **Why buy a detailed Legal Nomads gluten free translation card?**

*   Each card is carefully crafted by someone with celiac disease, and then goes through 2 sets of translations to ensure accuracy.

*   Unlike shorter, less-detailed cards, each card it lists out local ingredients and dishes that have hidden (and not hidden!) gluten in them. Saying "I can't have gluten" just isn't usually enough to keep celiacs safe â€” many people preparing your food don't know what ingredients have gluten in them.
*   It expressly mentions that we cannot eat food from pans, shared fryers, or cooking surfaces that have had cross-contact with gluten.
*   It helps communicate what celiacs _can_ eat via a list of safe ingredients.
*   To ensure the card is taken seriously, it adds an apology for the inconvenience, and emphasizes that avoiding gluten is a medical obligation â€” not a choice.

#### NOTE: If you have any questions about this card, or are having trouble purchasing or downloading it, or accessing your English translation of the card, please send me an email to [jodi@legalnomads.com](mailto:jodi@legalnomads.com). If you purchase via credit card, your statement charge will read "Gumroad" (the e-commerce platform where I sell these cards).

Hi, Iâ€™m Jodi. Welcome to Legal Nomads.

In 2008, I quit my job as a lawyer to visit Siberia. I started Legal Nomads to share photos and stories from my travels with friends and family. I planned to take only a year sabbatical to travel the world.

I never returned to the law. Instead,Â this site became the backbone ofÂ a new career in the decade that followed. As its audience grew, so did my appetite. Food was the best way I could connect to others in a new place. As a celiac, learning about food helped me navigate with less anxiety and chance of illness.

In 2017, a lumbar puncture derailed my life when it left me with a chronic spinal CSF leak, and disabled. Though my travels ground to a halt as a result, Legal Nomads remains a place to share lessons from the road, gluten free travel guides, and alternative careers for those wanting to leave the practice of law. On my sister site, I share resources about coping with grief and chronic pain, and what Iâ€™ve learned from this journey with chronic illness.

Through it all, Legal Nomads remains a place to connect with others through curiosity and discovery. I hope you enjoy reading!
