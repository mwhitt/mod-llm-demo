### **This is a Japanese gluten free card, written by a celiac and translated by native Japanese speakers familiar with the condition. I traveled the world with celiac disease for a decade and created these cards in 2014 to help others with the condition travel safely.**

### **Why buy a detailed Legal Nomads gluten free translation card?**

*   Each card is carefully crafted by someone with celiac disease, and then goes through 2 sets of translations to ensure accuracy.

*   Unlike shorter, less-detailed cards, each card it lists out local ingredients and dishes that have hidden (and not hidden!) gluten in them. Saying "I can't have gluten" just isn't usually enough to keep celiacs safe â€” many people preparing your food don't know what ingredients have gluten in them.
*   It expressly mentions that we cannot eat food from pans, shared fryers, or cooking surfaces that have had cross-contact with gluten.
*   It helps communicate what celiacs _can_ eat via a list of safe ingredients.
*   To ensure the card is taken seriously, it adds an apology for the inconvenience, and emphasizes that avoiding gluten is a medical obligation â€” not a choice.

#### NOTE: If you have any questions about this card, or are having trouble purchasing or downloading it, or accessing your English translation of the card, please send me an email to [jodi@legalnomads.com](mailto:jodi@legalnomads.com). If you purchase via credit card, your statement charge will read "Gumroad" (the e-commerce platform where I sell these cards).
