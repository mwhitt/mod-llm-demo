The goal is to help you understand the full capabilities of Capture One's tools, enabling you to choose the right tool for each task. For instance, Capture One offers several methods for adjusting contrast and light balance, each serving a distinct purpose in your photographic toolbox.

When you have clicked View product in your email to get access to the eBook, please make sure that you click on Download (instead of Read) to save the eBook on your iOS device/computer. The Gumroad e-reader doesn’t work that well with such a huge book.

The eBook is published in a so-called fixed layout format which means that you can’t change the size of the font to let the text reflow in the ePub version. This is by design because it was important for me to make sure that the text and illustrations are kept together. The pdf version will, however, let you resize the book to fit your screen.

Please check the sample chapter (see above) to see whether the eBook is easy to read on your device or computer before purchase, especially if you need to read it on an Android device. If you have trouble reading the ePub file on an Android device, try using the Publiwide Reader EPUB3 

Otherwise, use the all-purpose pdf version.
