### **FAQ**

**What is Gamified Life OS?**  
Gamified Life OS is a productivity tool created in Notion. It combines gamification with regular daily life activities such as habits, tasks, goals, reading, and even cooking, to create a uniquely effective productivity system.

**Can I learn more about Gamified Life OS?**  
Sure! Head here: **_Gamified Life OS_**

**Where else can I buy Gamified Life OS?**  
The only **official and authorized** **marketplaces** with Gamified Life OS are Gumroad, the Notion Marketplace, NichePlates, Notions.ws, and NotionCircles. Any unauthorized stores selling Gamified Life OS are likely **scams** and will **not** provide lifetime customer service and free upgrades.

**Which theme is the best?**  
All of the themes simply differ aesthetically. The functions and features are all still the same. I suggest you pick a theme that suits your personality. My personal favorite is the Studio Ghibli theme.

**What makes this different from other "Gamification" systems?**  
Gamified Life OS has always been about a good balance of gaming and practical use. I made sure that this system was the perfect mix of both. At the end of the day, we want an efficient and practical productivity tool, but something enjoyable to use.
