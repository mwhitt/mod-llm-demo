Markdown Content:
61 ratings

Pam shares some insights into how to synthesise astrological information in a birthchart. This is not an exhaustive natal analysis, but will go a long way to finding emphasis and meaning in a chart. Not for complete beginners. Topics covered are Planetary Symbolism, Where Planets become Stronger, Aspects, Blending Archetypes and Life Theme/Story. There will be new information in here that you may not get elsewhere, some by years of astrological observation.
