**People love using TextSniper**:

Gary Chike 👍   
_TextSniper has been a life saver. I had to take an online course that had questions in which the text were not selectable. So I was able to use TextSniper OCR to copy the text and paste it into a search engine to review._

Chauncey Davis 👍   
_I love this little app - I do a lot of training docs, and sometimes I need to grab quotes and more so numbers and codes that are in screen shots or images._

E Chu 👍   
_Awesome app! I use it to capture slide contents on Zoom calls. Highly recommended. Fast and accurate!_

Danielle Williams 👍  
_Can't imagine my computer without it. It does exactly what it says. I needed some text off of a pdf and it took it in perfectly._

We ensure that apps come from known sources, are free of known malware, and haven’t been tampered with at the time of installation or launch.

### 100% of apps are automatically screened for known malware.

### Over 16K apps use Apple health technologies like HealthKit, CareKit, and ResearchKit designed to protect patient privacy.

You choose what data to share. And with whom.

Each app is required to ask for your permission so you can choose what data to share. The first time a third‑party app wants to access your information — like your location, contacts, calendars, or photos — you receive an alert. Even if you grant access once, you can revoke it later. We also ensure that apps are denied access to certain sensitive data on your device, are unable to modify your device or OS, and are prohibited from obtaining complete access to your data.

### Over 215K submissions rejected last year for violating privacy guidelines.

When you download an app, it should work as promised. Which is why human App Reviewers ensure that the apps on the App Store adhere to our strict app review standards. Our App Store Review Guidelines require apps to be safe, provide a good user experience, comply with our privacy rules, secure devices from malware and threats, and use approved business models.

You should never have to worry about inappropriate content.

We strongly support all points of view being represented on the App Store. But we also take steps to make sure apps are respectful to users with differing opinions, and we reject apps with any content or behavior that we believe is over the line — especially when it puts children at risk. Every app has an assigned age rating, so parents can determine what is appropriate for their children.

### No surprise purchases.

More about No surprise purchases.

No surprise purchases.

Apps must follow an approved business model and clearly show you the price, tell you what you get with your purchase, and explain subscription-renewal terms up front. Apple sends a receipt each time you use our in‑app purchase feature, and you can also view those purchases and subscriptions in your account. So you won’t get bills out of the blue.
