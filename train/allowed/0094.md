**Review Highlight for Fortgeschrittenes Deutsch (C1-C2):**

_"Fantastic book!!! If you really want to pass the C2 Goethe exam or even the C1 TestDaF, this book covers current topics and is tested very frequently in the Goethe C2 exam. The best purchase for my preparation for C2 at such a reasonable price. Trust me, you can’t find this anywhere else and you need this book if you want to do well for the writing and speaking component. The amount of effort that went into this is immaculate."_
