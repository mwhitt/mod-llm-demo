A (non-exhaustive) list of the areas the playbook helps you decide on:

9.  Which font styles work best, and when
10.  What colors match your goal and product

**‚ùå What you should not expect**

*   Opinions from self-proclaimed ‚Äúexperts‚Äù. This is science.
*   Generic, vague information. It‚Äôs actionable and straight to the point.
*   A beginner's guide to ads. These are advanced optimization techniques.

**‚ùì FAQs**

**Q: Can I find this research elsewhere?**

Yes, you can analyze the research papers yourself (and should, if there‚Äôs one you‚Äôre deep diving into) in scientific journals such as the Journal of Marketing or Marketing Science. All studies are referenced and linked.

But unless you are someone who can review the 10,000+ marketing studies published each year, buys each research paper for $30+, and knows how to interpret academic research - you will have never heard of most of these new techniques. My team of PhDs and I are one of the very few with the ability to do this.

It‚Äôs very unlikely that you will find this research analyzed and summarized elsewhere. Most science-based insights you will find are recycled tropes of decades-old research. This is the latest scientific evidence that barely anyone is using yet.

**Q: Is this for new or established marketers and creatives?**

These recommendations are useful for any business, whether already established or just starting out. It also works in any industry (e.g. Ecommerce, service, SaaS). If you are looking to make better ads - this Playbook will help.

If you are a designer, these techniques will not teach the basics of effective creative design, they are meant to help you optimize on a more strategic level. However, if you are just starting out, you can use these guides to learn how to build effective marketing materials from the get go.

**Q: Is this just a collection of insights covered in the Science Says newsletter?**

No. Many of the insights in the playbook have been covered in the newsletter, others are brought in from new research papers. Science Says insights in the playbook are enriched with more examples, focused on optimizing ad creatives, and explained so that you can rapidly apply them to your ads.

You can subscribe to the Science Says Platform to access the library of hundreds of insights.

**Q: What kind of research is included in the playbook?**

All the studies covered in the playbook have survived rigorous statistical analyses, peer-review (i.e. picked apart and challenged by other scientists), and been published in a reputable scientific journal (e.g. Journal of Marketing Research).

Research that has not been published in a journal may not have been peer-reviewed, so it is not included.

**Q: What if I don‚Äôt see any results?**

You get your money back. If you tested techniques and didn‚Äôt see a statistically significant lift in conversions you will get a refund (within 30 days of purchase).

I‚Äôd appreciate it if you could share how you applied what didn‚Äôt work, so academic researchers can use the learning to advance our scientific understanding, but this is optional.

**Q: Considering all the above, the price seems a bit low**

The mission of Science Says is to close the gap between the latest science and practice. I try to keep the pricing accessible while generating enough margins.

The majority of revenue is spent on salaries (marketing PhDs who help analyze and verify the research, designers, and writers). The rest is invested in growing Science Says's reach and developing new products to be a sustainable business.
