Title: Born to Stand Out: Introverts guide to discover their true power

Markdown Content:
**Dear introvert, do you find it difficult to express yourself authentically?**

Introverts' greatest pain is unexpressed potential.

You have so many things to say. Thoughts, ideas, mind boggling insights.

But you keep it all inside. Locked up. Hidden away.

There are nights when you say to yourself, "I could’ve been so much more".

But you keep on living as a watered down version of yourself.

Over-giving to keep everyone happy.

Sacrificing your needs for others.

Insatiable hunger for external approval.

Promising ideas that die stillborn.

Destructive living and eating habits.

Dreams that are never fulfilled.

Chronic anxiety or depression.

Can't let go of toxic one-sided relationships.

A marriage that brings only frustration.

A career that never goes anywhere.

Sounds familiar?

And you'd be surprised to know that all of the above stem from one and one thing only: **TRAUMA**.

The choking resistance you feel whenever you try to express yourself is because of three mental viruses: **_Fear, Guilt, and Shame_**.

These three mental viruses stem from **childhood trauma** that is stored in your unconscious mind as self-limiting patterns & behaviours.

But what if you could heal everything above?

What if you could confidently express your true authentic self?

Imagine if you stopped caring about people and became the most unapologetic, unstoppable, unfuckwithable version of yourself.

And deep in your heart, you know you can.

You know who you are and what you're capable of.

But you're forced to live as a watered-down version of yourself because of these patterns and behaviours control you from the unconscious.
