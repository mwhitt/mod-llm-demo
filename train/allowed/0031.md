M2TM Notes is a powerful **MIDI tool for Ableton Live 12 Suite Edition** that changes how you compose. With M2TM Notes, you can effortlessly create music into the piano roll simply by typing note names and chord symbols. Enjoy precise control over attributes like duration, velocity, gate, probability, and every other parameter supported by Ableton Live.

By introducing an intuitive **text-based syntax** to describe melodies and chords, M2TM Notes bridges the gap between your DAW and **AI tools** like ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, and more. For instance, you can ask ChatGPT to craft a melody or bass line with specific characteristics — such as key, scale, interval size, and preferred note durations — and paste the AI's response directly into M2TM Notes. The connection is bidirectional: create a melody in Ableton's piano roll, convert it into text with M2TM Notes, and ask ChatGPT to generate chord progressions or counter-melodies.

But M2TM Notes goes far beyond simple note entry. It includes a lightweight yet versatile **music-oriented programming language** that supports advanced features like **arpeggios**, chord strumming, automatic **voice leading**, time humanization, swing, scale quantization, **drum pattern** generation, and more. You can randomize all note attributes, including pitch, velocity, and duration, and even generate **random harmonies**. This tool empowers you to create **personalized melodies**, bass lines, and chord progressions tailored to your specific needs — offering a level of flexibility and creativity that surpasses traditional "stock" riff generators.

M2TM Notes unlocks a world of creative possibilities for **live coding**, allowing you to type note sequences directly into its editor. While Ableton Live loops your clip, you can instantly apply and hear your changes in real-time, enabling dynamic, on-the-fly experimentation without interrupting your workflow. Whether you're crafting melodies, chord progressions, or intricate rhythms, M2TM Notes seamlessly integrates with your creative process, making every loop a canvas for your ideas.

M2TM Notes includes comprehensive documentation to support your creative journey. It starts with a straightforward **Quick Start** guide, offering a few simple steps to get you up and running right away. Next, the **Code Recipe** collection provides hundreds of ready-to-use examples that you can copy, tweak, and adapt to your needs, ensuring you're productive in no time. For in-depth learning, the complete **Reference Manual** covers all commands and features in detail, along with expert tips and advanced techniques to help you master the tool.
