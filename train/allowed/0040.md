### **How do you use it ?** ðŸ–¥

For ease of understanding, remember to follow the video tutorial and read the pdf. The first time you use it, you'll be able to choose between a classic log to rec709 conversion or a conversion using the film emulation format, so you'll already have a look inspired by the finest films.  
It's important to respect the order of the schema, as it's designed to optimize your renderings.You can also use it on videos in rec709, simply by deactivating the conversion nodes.
