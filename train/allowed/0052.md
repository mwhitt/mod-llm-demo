**Flexible and easy to use**

All presets can be used on adjustment layers which lets you apply this effect to multiple layers (ie. graphics) at the same time.

To apply it you simply drag and drop from the Effects panel.

Use scenarios are endless. From feature films to talking head videos.

**Fast render time**

All presets are GPU accelerated and resolution-independent.

You can use it for 4K, UHD, 1080p timelines as well as for vertical and square aspect ratios.

**Customizable**

You can access keyframes and adjust the speed if you need to.

With anchor type information provided, you can not only make changes to presets easily but also have total control over the results.

Often times when we get a plugin or a preset to improve our editing arsenals, weÂ are fixing a problem, but we're also adding an extra step. It's time for you to switchÂ it up and actually save time while editing. That's why we created a preset packÂ called Essential Motion.

We're fixing a non-creative problem: You're wasting time! Stop creating newÂ keyframes for every zoom you want to add to a clip. Use these simple drag &Â drop,Â non-destructive presets instead, and adjust if necessary. You will already startÂ saving time today, and it will really add up in the long run. Think about the manyÂ things you can do with extra time: ginally watch that last season of Seinfeld, learn aÂ new song on your octobass, learn to play the octobass, get married to that girlÂ you've been dating for 12 years (it's time)... so many possibilities!

All **40 presets** are as flexible as we could have made them: resolution-independent,Â easily accessible keyframes, can be used in a wide variety of scenarios and they'reÂ all GPU accelerated.

*   clicking 10 times to set the guides just the way you need them,
*   re-applying Warp Stabilizer with default settings.

With Ultimate Presets you will startÂ saving time today and it will add up in the long run. Think about the manyÂ things you can do with extra time: finally watch that last season of Seinfeld, learn to play the octobass, get married to that girlÂ you've been dating for 12 years (it's time)... so many possibilities!
