Month of Sundays: Family Meals for Every Occasion.

I'm selling this on behalf of my grandma; this is been a multi-year labor of love designed as a Christmas present for her family. After posting about it many people wanted to purchase a copy, so here it is.

A 380-page, full-color cookbook with all of her favorite recipes sheâ€™s collected over the decades. She spent the past few years typing out her hundreds of handwritten recipe cards and taking photos of everything she makes.

Proceeds will go to reformatting to create an ePub version (which I'll turn around to send to everyone who buys the PDF), printing copies to give away, and the remainder will undoubtedly go directly into grandma's garden.
