Why does the checkout process happen on gumroad.com?

We sell most of our products through the Gumroad platform. This is one of the best e-commerce services for small creative teams (like our Motion Bro team) and startups.

On how many computers can I use Motion Bro products?

You can use **one purchase code only for one end user**. You can use one purchase code on two devices, for example, on a desktop computer and a laptop.

I applied Motion Bro presets to my video project. Will this project work on a computer without the Motion Bro plugin installed?

Only standard After Effects and Premiere Pro effects are used to create presets; also, as presets, popular file formats are used, such as .mov, .mp4, .wav, etc. The Motion Bro plugin is only needed for easy search, application, and customization presets. Thus, a project with Motion Bro presets will work on a computer without a plugin installed.

Can I create my presets pack compatible with Motion Bro?

Yes, you can create your own package, including a commercial package for sale. Using the plugin's features is free for you, and we do not charge any commission; however, there are some conditions for legal use of the plugin. The main rule is that your package, which you plan to share or sell, must not infringe anyone's copyright.
